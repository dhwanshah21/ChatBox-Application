# ChatBox Application

  ChatBox is a small chat application where users can chat on localhost.

## Steps To Run The Application

- Run yarn/npm install to install the dependencies.
- pm2 start process.config.js to start all the backend services
- Run yarn start or npm start to run the app and go to http://localhost:3000/ to view. 
  I have tested it on chrome browser.

## Technologies 

- redis, mongodb, HTML, CSS, Javascript (ES6), React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, websocket

## Future Enhancements
